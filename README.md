# Dice Math

## About

This math quiz program rolls two to six dice whose sides you must add up as quickly as possible. 
But this program operates as more than just automated flash cards; it draws the faces of the dice 
to random places on the screen. The ASCII-art aspect adds a fun twist while you practice arithmetic.
